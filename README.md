**Crafting/Useage:**

Rename another eye of ender to "Raijin", the trident will be enchanted and you will recieve a special item.    
**2:** Throw the trident and Right click the Raijin Item to teleport to the trident._  
**Spare Raijin Link Crafting:** Rename an eye of ender to "Raijin" and you will recieve a Raijin link. 

~~(You can also throw an old Named/enchanted Carrot on a stick into 
the crafting mix to upgrade it to a Raijin Carrot.)~~  
      You Can Rename and Enchant your Raijin trident before or after its been Raijinified.  
      (in 10.8 the carrot on a stick got a custom resource pack, but in order to see it
