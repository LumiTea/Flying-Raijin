### Java Edition - Data pack  
#### (Compatible with all MC versions (1.9) - 1.13 - 1.17 snapshots)  

A Datapack that lets you and your players become Minato Namikaze from Naruto.    
(Craft Tridents into Teleportation Kunai)  

### Crafting/Useage:   
_**1:** Spit any Trident, a name tag and an eye of ender on top of an enchanting table,    
Rename another eye of ender to "Raijin", the trident will be enchanted and you will recieve a special item.    
**2:** Throw the trident and Right click the Raijin Item to teleport to the trident._  
**Spare Raijin Link Crafting:** Rename an eye of ender to "Raijin" and you will recieve a Raijin link. 

~~(You can also throw an old Named/enchanted Carrot on a stick into 
the crafting mix to upgrade it to a Raijin Carrot.)~~  
      You Can Rename and Enchant your Raijin trident before or after its been Raijinified.  
      (in 10.8 the carrot on a stick got a custom resource pack, but in order to see it  
      you must re-craft the Raijin.)
